## Hi, I am Fagner, Nice to meet you!
**sorry if the format here is a little confusing, im still adjusting* :(

I am Web Developer working with Ruby on Rails since 2013. Looking for the next adventure!

#### Languages and Frameworks I have been working with:

Ruby on Rails + Stimulus + Turbo + TailwindCss = S2

I also have already worked in VueJs projects. Even not being an AWESOME frontend developer, I'm able to build and maintain such projects ;)

#### Some cool side projects:

- [Pix AnÃ´nimo](https://pixanonimo.com.br) -> App to send transfers between all Brazilian banks using [PIX](https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/financialstability/pix_en) without having personal (Name, CPF, E-mail, Phone) data exposed for sender and receiver.
  - Stack: Ruby on Rails, Hotwire, TailwindCSS, Faraday, Cloud run, Rds, Rspec

- [Como Fazer](https://comofazer-app-service-ixwdcihzgq-uc.a.run.app/) -> How to make quick and simple food recipes generator.
  - Stack: Ruby on Rails, Hotwire, TailwindCSS, Openai, Cloud run, Rds, Minitest

- Kikofe - BR Alternative for Ko-fi and Buymeacoffe.
  - It's not on air cause Heroku started to charge me, and I was lazy to set up again... Also because I was expecting to be rich with it. But the dream is over hehehe.
  - Stack: Ruby on (I know you are tired of reading Rails, but Love it and can't stop, sorry) Rails, Hotwire, Tailwindcss, Stripe (and others local payment gateways that I integrated before moving to Stripe S2), Rspec, Pundit, Devise, Sidekiq...

#### Last experiences:

- Youse: Insurance
- Smartrmail: Email Marketing
- Clicksign: Digital Signatures (much better than DocuSign) and I am proud to help them when it was only my and CTO coding. After 5 years I left, and now they have 300 employees, just a coincidence, ok? HAHAHAHA
- Locaweb: Hosting -> Where I have met and got married with Ruby and Rails (no monogamy)
- BRQ

PS: All web development experience with R.A.I.L.S, sometimes with something different like PHP, JS, Vuejs, Abap, Cobol haha. Where i didnt detailed is because its more of same, CRUDs, fixing, meetings....
