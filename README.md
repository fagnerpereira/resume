Hi, Im Fagner, nice to meet you!
I am Web Developer working with Ruby on Rails since 2013. Looking for the next adventure!

Languages and Frameworks I have been working with:
Ruby on Rails + Stimulus + Turbo + TailwindCss = S2
I have already worked in VueJs projects. Even not being a AWESOME frontend developer Im able to build and maintain such projects ;)

Some cool side projects:
Pix AnÃ´nimo -> App to send transferences between banks using [PIX](https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/financialstability/pix_en) without having personal data exposed for sender and receiver.
