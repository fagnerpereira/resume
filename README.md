Kikofe - BR Alternative for Ko-fi and Buymeacoffe.
Its not on air cause Heroku started to charge me and I was lazy to setup again... Also because I was expecting to be rich with it. But the dream is over hehehe.
Stack: Ruby on (I know you are tired of reading Rails, but Love it and cant stop, sorry) Rails, Hotwire, Tailwindcss, Stripe (and others local payment gateways that i integrated before moving to Stripe S2), Rspec, Pundit, Devise, Sidekiq...
